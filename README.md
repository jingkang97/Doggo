# Doggo

Are you a dog lover? Have you ever wondered what is the species that is lying there sleeping in front of you or barking at you? Doggo is the app to go! 

Doggo lets you take a snap shot of a dog and tells you what breed it is. You get to find out more about the breed after you took a snapshot of it and unlock that breed!
